# Route-Mapping
<justify>The Route Mapping project utilizes a modified Dijkstra algorithm to efficiently find three shortest paths between two airports. Additionally, it identifies three cost-effective routes and provides real-time weather information for all the airports involved. Unlike existing mapping services such as Google Maps, this project specifically addresses the challenge of navigating between airports, including those separated by bodies of water. This functionality is particularly significant for travelers and logistics planners who need to optimize routes based on both distance and cost considerations, taking into account the unique constraints of air travel. The inclusion of weather information further enhances the project's utility, allowing users to make informed decisions about their routes based on current weather conditions. This project contributes to the field of route optimization and extends the capabilities of traditional mapping services to better serve the aviation and logistics industries.</justify>
